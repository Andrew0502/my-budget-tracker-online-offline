## Description
  The budget tracker is a means of keeping track of one's spending habits and displays them in a list and in a graph form. The homework focused on building the back end. The model and controller were built from scratch to make the app function. It uses MongoDB to keep track of the data, and this is much easier than with SQL and sequlize that requires a far more structured database. This project had problems connecting to Mongodb Atlas, though those issues were quickly taken care of.
